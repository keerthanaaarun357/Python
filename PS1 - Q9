#Get a DOB from the user which is an 8 digit number. Check whether it is a Lucky number or not by following the steps below: 

Step-1: Calculate the sum of the digits in the odd-numbered positions (the first, third, fifth and seventh digits) and multiply this sum by 3.
 
Step-2: Calculate the sum of the digits in the even-numbered positions (the second, fourth, sixth and eighth digits) and add this to the previous result (got in step 1). 

Given Date of Birth is declared as a lucky number, only if the last digit of the result from step 2 is 0.

Develop an algorithm and write a python program to read the Date of Birth, if the number of digits is not 8 then print “Invalid Input” and terminate the program. If the number of digits is 8 and if the DOB is a lucky number, output the DOB with the message “Lucky Number.” If the number of digits is 8 and if the DOB is not a lucky number, output the DOB with the message “Not a Lucky Number.” 
For example the DOB is 12032003, 
The result from step 1 is 9
The result from step 2 is 17 
The output is 12032003, “Not a Lucky Number”. 

For example the DOB is 13101978, 
The result from step 1 is 30 
The result from step 2 is 50 
The output is 13101978, “Lucky Number.” 

For example if the DOB is 1110197, 
The output is “Invalid Input”
###

DOB = input('Enter DOB: ')

if len(DOB)<8 or len(DOB)>8:
    print('Invalid Input')
    
else:
    print(DOB, end = ', ')
    
    stepi = (int(DOB[0])+int(DOB[2])+int(DOB[4])+int(DOB[6]))
    stepii = (int(DOB[1])+int(DOB[3])+int(DOB[5])+int(DOB[7]))
    stepii = stepii*3
    
    sum = str(stepi + stepii)
    
    if sum[-1]=='0'':
        print('Lucky Number')
        
    else:
        print('Not a Lucky Number')
