#@Determine the height of the tower that can be reached by the ladder, given the length and angle in which the ladder has to be leaned on the tower. Write PAC, flowchart and python code for determining the height of the tower. Length of the ladder is given in feet and angle to lean the ladder is given in degrees. Display the height of the tower, with two decimal places. 

#Height of the tower = Length of the ladder * sine (Angle in radians). Angle in radians = (Pi /180) * Angle in degrees.


len = int(input('Enter length of ladder: '))
theta = int(input('Enter angle in degrees: '))

import math

alpha = (math.pi/180) * theta
x = (math.sin(alpha))

height = len*x
print('%.2f'%height)
