#A student will not be allowed to sit in an exam if his/her attendance is less than 75%. Take the following input from users such as Number of classes held, Number of classes attended and also student medical proof availability [1(for Yes)/0 (for No)]. Display percentage of class attended and eligibility detail (Allowed/ Not Allowed) for exam. If the student is having less than 75% but having medical proof, he/she is ‘Allowed’ for the exam, otherwise ‘Not Allowed’.


held = int(input('Enter total no. of classes: '))
attended = int(input('Enter no. of classes attended: '))

percent = (attended/held)*100

medical = int(input('Medical Proof Availability[0/1]: '))

print(int(percent))

if percent > 75:
    print("Allowed")
    
elif medical == 1:
    print("Allowed")
    
else:
    print("Not allowed")
