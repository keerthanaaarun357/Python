#Write a PAC chart, flowchart, algorithm and python code for the question given below. An online educational platform offers three courses: Programming Courses, Robotics Courses and Academic Writing Courses. The vendor gives a discount of 10% on orders for programming based courses if the order is for more than Rs. 1000. On orders of more than Rs. 750 for Robotics Courses, a discount of 5% is given and a discount of 10% is given on orders for academic writing courses of value more than Rs. 500. Assume that the numeric codes 1, 2 and 3 are used for Programming, Robotics and Academic Writing Courses respectively. Write a program that reads the product code and the order amount and prints out the net amount that the learner is required to pay after the discount. 


course = int(input('Enter 1, 2, 3 for course: '))

if course == 1:
    cost = float(input('Enter cost: '))

    if cost>1000:
        cost = cost-(cost/10)

    print('%.2f'%cost)
    
elif course == 2:
    cost = float(input('Enter cost: '))

    if cost>750:
        cost -= cost/20

    print('%.2f'%cost)
    
else:
    cost = float(input('Enter cost: '))

    if cost>500:
        cost -= cost/10

    print('%.2f'%cost)
